# sapjco

This project defines some parts of sapidoc3 API for SAP

It does not implement any function of this API.

It simply allows to compile jco-factory when you do not have the SAP library.

It is of no use during at runtime. In this case it is necessary to download the original bookseller on the servers of SAP.
